Collection of scripts for creating a disk image, installing, and calling a W10 VM using Intel GVT-g acceleration and virtio.  Includes spice for clipboard passthrough and samba for accessing host drives. 

TODO: change tablet to mouse, add virtio-mouse & virtio-kbd, use gvt-g directly w/ dmabuf for direct output instead of qxl & gvt-g
